Personal Finance Tracker
Distinctiveness and Complexity
This project is a Personal Finance Tracker, a web application designed to help users manage and track their personal finances, specifically focusing on transactions, budgeting, and spending analysis. This application goes beyond simple transaction logging by integrating advanced features such as dynamic statistics visualization with interactive charts and transaction reports that can be downloaded in PDF or CSV formats. The complexity lies in the backend setup with Django, involving data modeling for transactions, user accounts, and reporting functionalities. The frontend integrates JavaScript (with Chart.js and HTML2Canvas) to provide a seamless and engaging user experience, ensuring that the project is mobile-responsive.

Key differentiators:

Category-wise Spending Analysis: Visual representation of spending patterns across various categories using pie charts.
Monthly Spending Overview: Detailed spending analysis over time through bar charts.
Report Generation: Option to download transaction data as PDFs or CSV files, adding extra functionality not present in similar projects.
User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their transactions.
This project meets the complexity requirements by combining backend functionality (modeling, database integration, user management) with frontend interactivity (charts, dynamic content loading, and report generation), ensuring it stands apart from simpler e-commerce or social network projects.

Project Overview
The Personal Finance Tracker allows users to:

Track all financial transactions including income and expenses.
Categorize transactions for easy analysis.
Visualize spending patterns over different periods.
Download detailed reports (PDF or CSV) of their transactions.
The application includes the following features:

User Registration & Authentication: Ensures secure login and personalized experience.
Add and Edit Transactions: Users can log new transactions, modify existing ones, and categorize them.
Interactive Charts: Using Chart.js, users can see spending breakdowns both by category and by month.
Download Reports: The application allows downloading transaction details in CSV or PDF format, which is facilitated by jsPDF and html2canvas.
Mobile-Responsive Design: The frontend is built using Bootstrap, ensuring the application works well across all screen sizes.
Project Structure
This project includes multiple files and directories for both the backend and frontend:

transactions/ (Django app)
models.py: Defines the Transaction model to store transaction data (amount, description, category, date).
views.py: Contains views to handle displaying transactions, generating reports, and rendering statistics.
urls.py: Defines the URLs for different pages such as adding transactions, viewing stats, and downloading reports.
templates/: Contains HTML templates for rendering views.
index.html: Home page displaying transaction input forms and charts.
stats.html: Page with category-wise and monthly spending charts.
static/
css/: Contains styling files like styles.css for custom styling.
js/: Contains JavaScript files such as script.js for handling chart rendering and user interactions.
requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies required to run the application, such as Django, Chart.js, and jsPDF.

Dependencies
This project uses the following Python packages:

Django: Web framework for backend logic and data handling.
chart.js: JavaScript library for rendering interactive charts on the frontend.
html2canvas: JavaScript library used to capture HTML elements as images, which are later added to the PDF report.
jsPDF: JavaScript library for generating PDF files, used to download transaction reports.
Additional Information
Mobile-Responsiveness: The app is built to be fully mobile-responsive using Bootstrap, ensuring that users can access the platform on any device.
Chart Customization: Users can interact with charts to see more details about their spending.
PDF and CSV Download: A significant feature that allows users to download their transaction data in both PDF and CSV formats. This is ideal for users who need to analyze or share their spending data outside the application.
